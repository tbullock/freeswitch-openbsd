Freeswitch on OpenBSD
=====================

This is a shallow fork of Freeswitch for use on OpenBSD.

Reason
======

Freeswitch bundles almost all its dependancies inside its source tree, which is
a nightmare for packagers to work around.  Since OpenBSD and Freeswitch are 
important to me and my business, I am taking the time to build this.

As testament to how difficult it is to package Freeswitch, none of the major
linux distributions have made official packages.

Also at the time of writing, Freeswitch does not compile on OpenBSD, and I can
not possibly be bothered to replicate all the porting work that was done on
the dependancies to get them to 'work on OpenBSD' (yawn).

Point
=====

To make Freeswitch a first class citizen on OpenBSD and to eventually have a
real Freeswitch port included in OpenBSD.

Dependancies
============

We depend on the following OpenBSD ports:

spandsp
libsrtp
libapr
miniupnpc
libnatpmp
<more to follow as work progresses>

Building
========

Install the list of dependancies

Installation from source should be as simple as:

> make && make install

Proviso: Until the porting work is actually complete the previous command is
basically a fantasy.
